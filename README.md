# less-css-npm

PLUGINS ARE HARD!

This thing is still mostly useless even to me. Work will continue.

## Usage

FIXME: Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[less-css-npm "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
less-css-npm 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

FIXME: Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[less-css-npm "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein less-css-npm
